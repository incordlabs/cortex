# How to read this book

Throughout this book, we maintain the following structure.

## Linking

When referring to structures or functions within codebase, we provide permalinks to the lines in
specific commits, and indicate them by the relative path of their parent file from the project root.
For example this is a reference to the `Tensor` struct in
[`crates/cortex-tensor/src/tensor/api/base.rs`](https://github.com/qora-protocol/cortex/blob/e303e31c8bc85486690ff80df65d1e25e16728c4/crates/cortex-tensor/src/tensor/api/base.rs#L27)

When some reference information is useful but is beyond the scope of contributing to Cortex, we
provide that information in a footnote. To build on the previous example, the `Tensor` mentioned is
what's referred to as a newtype struct[^1].

Direct hyperlinks are for tools and resources that are not part of the Cortex project, but are useful
for contributing to it. For example, when working on implementing an operation for autodiff, it can
be useful to use [symbolab](https://www.symbolab.com/) to calculate the left and right partial
derivatives.

[^1]: For more information on newtype please refer to
